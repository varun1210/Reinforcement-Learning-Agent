# Reinforcement-Learning-Agent
This project uses [Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/index.html) to emulate a robot in the classic reinforcement learning Grid World Problem.
I then use the SARSA and Q-Learning algorithms to implement a solution to the grid world and perform a comparative study.

I have used [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) to find the best hyperparameters within an arbitrary range, to solve the problem in the fastest time (fewest number of episode iterations).

A detailed explanation of the problem, environment, robot, constraints, methods, and comparative study between the performance of the two algorithms are offered in the Jupyter Notebooks and PDF file.
